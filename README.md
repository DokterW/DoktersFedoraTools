# Dokter's Fedora Tools

A collection of handy tools at your fingertips. Instead of typing a bunch a commands, you might only need to hit one button and the information you are looking for will be on your screen, nicely formated for your convenience.

1. Install

Download or git clone, then run dokter.sh -- that's it.

At first run it will create a folder, .DoktersTools, in your home directory. This allows your to keep your settings whenever I upgrade this bash script collection.

2. History

I started learning bash scripting around 2005-2006. When I started working on this specific program I do not remember. What I do remember is that it has gone through a lot of changes. It was first created on a Linux box, if my memory serves me right, then it moved across to Mac OS X where it got a lot of new features. I kept working on it on and off. At one point it had 8 different menus -- too many if you ask me.

Now that I'm back with Linux again I (kind of) "ported" the Mac version of Dokter's Tools from Mac to Linux, more specifically, Fedora Linux (GNOME), and slimmed it down.

3. Addendum

Later on, when I find the time I will write a feature list and even comment the code.
